				<div class="read-more-content">				
					<p>Cognitive Analytic Therapy, or CAT, is a focused, timelimited psychological therapy suitable for a wide range of conditions. Patients are usually seen for between 16 and 24 weeks (once a week for an hour). CAT is useful for very brief therapy i.e. 6 sessions, because it facilitates a focused and collaborative approach with the client. CAT offers a way of working with the problematic ways a person thinks, feels and acts, and the events and relationships (often from childhood) that underlie their current experiences and maintain their problems. It is tailored to a person’s individual needs and to his or her own manageable goals. It aims to enable recognition and change and gives patients tools and strategies for maintaining their progress. There is an established network of private practitioners.</p>

			<div class="question">			
			<h1 class="read-more-toggle">How does CAT work?</h1>				
				<div class="read-more-content">				
					<p>CAT is a very active therapy, inviting you to be the observer of your own life and to take part in what needs to change. The changes needed may be small, such as stopping being caught in a trap of avoiding things, or they may be larger, such as finding new ways to relating to new people.</br></br>

			<div class="question">			
			<h1 class="read-more-toggle">What can CAT be used to treat?</h1>		
				<div class="read-more-content">				
					<p>CAT can be used to treat patients with:
					<ul>
						<li>Adult mental health problems in primary, secondary andtertiary care settings, with few exlcusion criteria (mainly severe substance misuse).</li></br>
						<li>Many people presenting with anxiety or depression toprimary care services have a history of abuse, trauma or neglect underlying their symptoms. CAT offers a safe and clinically effective therapy intervention, compatible with the stepped care model and complementary to the existing IAPT interventions, for people who wish to work through these underlying issues rather than focus on the symptoms.</li></br>
						<li>Neurotic problems (including depression, anxiety and eating disorders), personality disorders (particularly borderline personality disorder), and some psychotic diagnoses (e.g. bipolar); suicidality or repeated selfharm.
						</li></br>
						<li>Difficulties in relationships, including problems of anger control, sexual difficulties, bereavement, loss and chronic trauma/abuse.</li></br>
						<li>Lifespan issues: e.g. in older adults; adolescent mental health difficulties; parenting issues re children seen in CAMHS.</li></br>
						<li>Physical heath difficulties, including problems of adaptation; non-compliance with medical treatment, especially in primary care (e.g. diabetes, asthma).</li></br>
						<li>Learning disabilities, and in forensic settings.</li>
					</ul></p>

			<div class="question">			
			<h1 class="read-more-toggle">What training is available from CAT?</h1>
				<div class="read-more-content">				
					<p><ul>
						<li>Practitioner training is designed for core mental health professionals with competence in their own field to learn the theory and methods of CAT to enhance their understanding and skills in an evidence-based psychological therapy.</li></br>
						<li>Accredited Practitioner Training – 2 years in-service, part-time; 20 training days, 8 completed supervised cases, seminars, written work, own CAT training therapy. There are about 10 training courses per annum across the UK.</li></br>
						<li>Most Practitioner trainings are Postgraduate Diplomas leading to ACAT Accreditation and a Diploma in CAT awarded by Sheffield Hallam University.
						</li></br>
						<li>The training is of sufficient depth and breadth to enable graduates to work with complex clients such as those with personality disorders.</li></br>
						<li>Practitioners graduate with highly transferable skills, and a multidisciplinary approach.</li></br>
						<li>CAT skills training is designed for those working in the health and caring professions to acquire a basic understanding of CAT and to apply it to their routine work, rather than to practice CAT as an individual therapy. The training may be delivered to whole teams or to groups of interested individuals. It can help clarify team tasks such as formulation and care/ treatment planning. By offering a shared language for formulation it can reduce inter-disciplinary tension. It provides a non-blaming, supportive, containing framework for everyone – including the client.</li></br>

			<h1 class="read-more-toggle">Why  was CAT developed for the NHS?</h1>	
				<div class="read-more-content">				
					<p>Dr Anthony Ryle (Guy’s and St Thomas’ Hospital, London) developed CAT from the 1980’s onwards in order to respond to the high demand for mental healthcare for a deprived and ethnically diverse busy inner London area. CAT recognises the social origins of distress and deprivation, and the need to offer short-term focused therapy for the NHS with its limited resources. It offers a model of therapy which is inclusive, no elitist and non-stigmatising, and equality and diversity are at the heart of its model. CAT integrates the best of different therapeutic approaches (including the cognitive psychotherapies and psychoanalytic approaches) into one integrated, user-friendly and effective therapy which is constantly being refined and is researchable.</p>
