				<div class="read-more-content">				
					<p>Cognitive Analytic Therapy, or CAT, is a focused, timelimited psychological therapy suitable for a wide range of conditions. Patients are usually seen for between 16 and 24 weeks (once a week for an hour). CAT is useful for very brief therapy i.e. 6 sessions, because it facilitates a focused and collaborative approach with the client. CAT offers a way of working with the problematic ways a person thinks, feels and acts, and the events and relationships (often from childhood) that underlie their current experiences and maintain their problems. It is tailored to a personâ€™s individual needs and to his or her own manageable goals. It aims to enable recognition and change and gives patients tools and strategies for maintaining their progress. There is an established network of private practitioners.</p>

			<h1 class="read-more-toggle">How does CAT work?</h1>				
				<div class="read-more-content">				
					<p>CAT is a very active therapy, inviting you to be the observer of your own life and to take part in what needs to change. The changes needed may be small, such as stopping being caught in a trap of avoiding things, or they may be larger, such as finding new ways to relating to new people.</br></br>
